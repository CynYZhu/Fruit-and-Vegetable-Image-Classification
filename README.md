# Fruit And Vegetables Image Classification

This project aims to classify fruits and vegetables using handcrafted features–including color and texture quantified by Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT), Histogram of Gradients (HOG), and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) – and learned features from ResNet pretrained models.
